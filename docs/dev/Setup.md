# Developer Setup Guide

## Overview

The Field-TM can be divided into four parts:

1. An API backend in FastAPI (code in: `src/backend`)
2. A desktop-based management frontend website in React (code in: `src/frontend`)
3. A mobile-based mapper frontend website in Svelte (code in: `src/mapper`)
4. Supporting services that tie everything together, such as [ODK Central][1]
   for collecting submission data, and an S3 service for storing files.

## Prerequisites

- Stable internet connection.
- Git installed on your system.
- Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system.

See further details [here][4]

## Setup: Repository Fork

### 1. Review documentation

Don't forget to review the [Contribution][5]
guidelines and our [Code of Conduct][6]
before contributing!

### 2. Fork the repository

Forking creates a copy of the repository in your own GitHub account.
Go to the
[Field Tasking Manager repository][7]
and click the "Fork" button in the top right corner of the page.

### 3. Navigate to your working directory

Open a terminal and navigate to the directory you want to work in using the
following command:

`cd <work-dir>`

Make sure to replace `<work-dir>` with the name of your directory.

### 4. Clone the forked repository

Clone the forked repository to your local machine using the following command:

`git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/fmtm.git`

Make sure to replace `<your-username>` with your GitHub username.

## Setup: Running Field-TM

See detailed instructions for this step [here][8].

## Setup: Contributing Code

### 1. Create a new branch

Create a new branch for your changes using the following command:

`git checkout -b branch-name`

Make sure to give your branch a descriptive name that reflects the changes
you'll be making.

### 2. Make changes

Make your contribution, run tests where needed and save.

### 3. Add changes

Add the changes you've made using the following command:

`git add <file-name>`

Make sure you replace `<file-name>` with the name of the file you made changes
to.

### 4. Commit and push

Once you've added changes, commit them to your local branch using the following
command:

`git commit -m "Add feature"`

Make sure to write a descriptive commit message that explains the changes you've
made. Then, push your changes to your forked repository using the following
command:

`git push origin branch-name`

### 5. Submit a pull request

Go to your forked repository on GitHub and click the "Pull requests" tab,
then click "Create pull request".

This will open a new pull request in the Field-TM repository, where you can:

- Select the branch you wish to merge into `development`.
- Describe your changes and request that they be merged into the main codebase.

That's it! You've now contributed to the Field Tasking Manager.

## Alternative Operating Systems

### Windows

Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) can be used to run Docker.

This will run a Linux machine inside Windows very efficiently.

To install follow the
[official instructions][11].

Then continue with the Field-TM installation.

### MacOS

[Colima][12] is recommended
to run `docker` and `docker compose` commands.

Install colima, docker, docker compose using brew:

```sh
brew install colima
brew install docker docker-compose
```

Then configure the docker compose plugin to work on MacOS:

```sh
mkdir -p ~/.docker/cli-plugins

ln -sfn $(brew --prefix)/opt/docker-compose/bin/docker-compose ~/.docker/cli-plugins/docker-compose
```

Run Colima:

```sh
colima start
```

Then continue with the Field-TM installation.

> Note: only tagged backend images are multi-architecture, supporting
> MacOS. The regular images for fast continuous deployment are not:
> `backend:development`, `backend:staging`, `backend:main`.

### A Note on Docker Desktop

While in theory Field-TM should run using Docker-Desktop, it has not
been tested.

The authors opinion is that the official Linux Docker Daemon
should be installed in WSL or MacOS, instead of using Docker Desktop.

> Colima is a wrapper to run the Docker Daemon.

Although Docker Desktop may have a user friendly GUI, it simply
runs docker commands inside a Linux virtual machine underneath.

It is often easier and more flexible to do this yourself.
Plus it gives you access to all other other tools available
in a Linux operating system!

## Help and Support
