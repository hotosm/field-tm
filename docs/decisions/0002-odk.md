# Use ODK as the underlying survey data collection tool

## Context and Problem Statement

FMTM requires the collection of structured data from users in the field,
using mobile phone-based data forms.

To save re-inventing the wheel, many other organizations have addressed
this common requirement, so we should incorporate their tooling into
FMTM.

## Considered Options

- Kobo
- ODK
- Ona.io
- Dimagi CommCare

## Decision Outcome

We chose ODK for two main reasons:

- HOT staff have used ODK successfully for many field data collection campaigns
  in the past, and can attest to it's suitableness.
- ODK appears to be at the forefront of this technology, for both product
  stability, and new feature innovation. Others mimic the same technology,
  building wrappers around ODK's tools.

### Consequences

- Good, because we do not need to implement the form creation logic.
- Good, because ODK uses simple technologies accessible to most users,
  such as XLSX spreadsheets to build forms.
- Good, because we do not need to implement the field data collection
  tool. Instead we need to develop the coordination layer above.
- Good, because ODK is extremely robust and battle tested. We can rely on it.
- Bad, we now have two tools and two databases to manage.
- Bad, it adds additional constraints to development, having to
  manage data flows in both FMTM and ODK (for example, as local-first
  approach to development becomes significantly harder).
