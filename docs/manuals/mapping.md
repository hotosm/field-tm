# Mapper Frontend Documentation

The **Mapper Frontend** was developed to provide a simpler, more intuitive
mapping experience.

## Prerequisites

### Device Requirements

Ensure you have an Android device for field mapping activities, as ODK is
not supported on iOS devices.

Verify that your mobile device meets the minimum specifications required
for field mapping:

- Minimum RAM: 4GB
- Storage: Ensure sufficient storage space is available (1GB should be enough).
- Operating System: ODK recommends using Android 10 or higher for
  the best security and performance.

#### Checking Device Specifications

- Go to the file manager or "My Files" on your mobile device to see
  the device storage.
- Check your phone settings for information about device settings
  such as RAM and processors.

### Browser Selection

- We recommend using the Chrome browser on your mobile device to access
  the FMTM platform for optimal performance.
- If you encounter difficulties using FMTM through the browser, you can
  add the FMTM browser shortcut to your home screen via the menu.

## Part (A): Setup For Mapping

### Step 1: Install The Custom ODK Collect Mobile App

- The first time you load the project, you should be prompted to download
  the custom `.apk` from the sidebar.
- Once downloaded, you should install the custom ODK Collect application.

  ![highlighted-sidebar](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/53de2d80-2709-45b0-bb82-32f0190c7859)
  ![download-custom-odk](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/22501751-4962-4cd7-ace1-7587269ae16c)

!!! tip

      If you already have ODK Collect installed, you may have to uninstall
      it first.

      You may have to enable installing from unknown sources in your device
      settings too.

### Step 2: Access the Mapper Frontend

- **Option 1:** Click the **Start Mapping** button on the project cards of
  explore project page.
- **Option 2:** Click the **Start Mapping** button on the project details page.
- **Option 3:** Go to `https://fmtm.hotosm.org/mapnow/<project_id>` to open
  the Mapper Frontend for a specific project.

!!! note

      This functionality is designed for mappers in the field, so it is
      recommended to use a mobile device to access it.

!!! warning

      Here you may log into the website to be attributed with you edits.

      If you do not log in, a generic account will be used to record your
      edits and data collection.

### Step 3: Configure ODK Collect (once only)

- **Option 1:** Scan the QR code displayed on the Mapper Frontend using
  the custom ODK Collect mobile application.

- **Option 2:** Download the QR code and import it into ODK Collect to
  load the project. Follow the steps below:

  1. Open ODK Collect.
  2. Click the project name in the top right corner.
  3. Tap the **menu** icon (three horizontal dots).
  4. Select **Import QR Code**.
  5. Browse to the downloaded QR image and load the project.

!!! tip

      For a demonstration of the process above, click the **i** info icon
      on the QR Code tab of the mapper frontend.

### Step 4: Load Imagery (optional)

- You can load the base imagery by clicking on offline mode option
  (second tab on bottom navigation bar).
- Choose the layer you want to load and click on **Show on Map** to visualise
  the layer on map.
- The layer can also be stored for offline mapping by clicking
  **Store Offline**.

  ![offline-pmtiles](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1c091df2-2db0-4546-b600-e2a3a339b981)

!!! tip

      This step should probably be done prior to leaving for the field!

      The files can be a few 100MB in size.

      MBTiles are used for loading into ODK Collect.
      PMTiles are used for navigating in FMTM.

      If you encounter issues with the base imagery, contact your project
      manager.

## Part (B): Mapping Features

Before starting to map features, ensure that geolocation is enabled.
This will allow you to access your live location, making navigation easier.

You may either map an **existing feature** OR map a **new feature**.

### Select An Existing Feature

In most cases we are submitting a survey about a feature that already exists.

- Click on a task area: the features within will be displayed.
- Now click on a feature you wish to map: a popup will appear.
- Now click 'Map Feature In ODK': ODK Collect will open, with the
  feature pre-selected in the survey (no need to open the ODK map!).
- Complete the survey and submit.

!!! tip

      You may manually click 'Start Mapping' for a task area.

      However, the task will be automatically locked for you
      if you map a feature within the task area.

!!! note

      The task area will change colour based on it's status.

      The legend explaining these colours can be opened on the map:

      ![legend](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/280fd927-b71e-4336-a89a-1672e8de687b)

### Mapping A New Feature

Sometimes the feature does not exist on the map yet!

- Click on a task area: a popup will display.
- At the top right, there is a button **Map New Feature**.
- Click on the map to create a new geometry.
- ODK Collect will be opened automatically to fill out the survey
  data for the newly created feature.

!!! note

      The task area will change colour based on it's status.

      Consult the project manager to determine if the feature should be a
      polygon (drawing all corners of the feature in ODK) or point
      (collecting only the GPS point of the feature).

      Confirm the exact point (gate location, right corner, center of the
      building) and GPS accuracy required for consistency and quality data.

### Repeat The Process

- Once the form is submitted, you have to get back to FMTM and select the
  another feature for mapping.
- You also also have to click the **Sync Status** button to see the feature
  turn green.
  ![sync-status-button](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/38062aad-c8ea-4d47-a617-4be70dbfa20c)
- Select another feature to map (repeat from step 5)!

!!! note

      You need internet access to update the feature status.

      In a future release, this process will be handled seamlessly
      without user interaction.
