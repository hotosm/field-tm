## project creation 

- Admin who has permission to create project should create a project
by filling all necessary data. 
- Fill basic information like project name and descriptions. 
- Select organisation and project managers. 
- Draw or Upload project boundary and create draft project.
! Tips: 
We accept both polygon and multipolygon for project boundary. But the
multipolygon is merged and accepted as single polygon moving forward. So
if you have disjoint polygons, we suggest to create multiple projects
