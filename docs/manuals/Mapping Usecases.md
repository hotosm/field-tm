# Road Survey 

## project creation 

- Admin who has permission to create project should create a project
by filling all necessary data. 
- Fill basic information like project name and descriptions. 
- Select organisation and project managers. 
- Draw or Upload project boundary and create draft project.
  
> Tips:
We accept both polygon and multipolygon for project boundary. But the
multipolygon is merged and accepted as single polygon moving forward. So
if you have disjoint polygons, we suggest to create multiple projects]

- You may choose the project type, add necessary hashtags, choose on whether to use
  default webform or odk collect mobile app for mapping exercises.
- You can enable and add TMS URL of base imagery if you have clearer satellite imagery
  of your project area.

- In forth step, Choose line as geometry to map.
- If you wish to include other related features like bridges as new feature, You can
 enable "I want to use a mix of geometry type" and select which type of new geometry feature you will map in field.
- If you are drawing lines for new feature encountered in field then you can disable the option and move ahead.
- Select "Fetch data from OSM", if you want to download highway within the project area from OSM.
- If you already have Highway data as geojson file, you can select "Fetch data from OSM" and upload the file. Refer (HERE)[https://docs.fmtm.dev/manuals/project-managers/#project-creation-tips] for project creation Tips
- If you are collecting features directly on field, then you can choose "No existing feature" and move ahead.

- For linear features survey, we suggest to use "Use uploaded AOI as task areas" rather than
  creating multiple tasks. Hence other options of dividing area into square tasks and tasks splitting
   algorithms are disabled in this case.
