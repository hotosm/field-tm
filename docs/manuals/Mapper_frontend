# Mapper Frontend Documentation

The **Mapper Frontend** is developed to provide a simpler, more intuitive mapping experience.  
Users can log in directly via URL or access the Mapper Frontend from the project details page.

## How to Start Mapping

Step 1: Access the Mapper Frontend  
- **Option 1:** Click the **Start Mapping** button on the project details page.  
- **Option 2:** Go to `fmtm.hotosm.org/mapnow/<project_id>` to open the Mapper Frontend for a specific project.  

*Note: This functionality is designed for mappers in the field, so it is recommended to use mobile browsers.*

Step 2: Set Up ODK Collect  

- **Option 1:** Scan the QR code displayed on the Mapper Frontend using the custom ODK Collect mobile application.  

- **Option 2:** Download the QR code and import it into ODK Collect to load the project. Follow the steps below:  
  1. Open ODK Collect.  
  2. Click the project name in the top right corner.  
  3. Tap the **menu** icon (three horizontal dots).  
  4. Select **Import QR Code**.  
  5. Browse to the downloaded QR image and load the project.

For a video guide, click the **info icon** on the Mapper Frontend to watch a video tutorial on how to load the QR code.
You can load the reference base imagery by clicking on offline mode option (second tab on bottom navigation bar). Choose the layer you want to load and click on *Load layer* to visualise the layer on map.

Step 3: On mapper frontend, lock the feature you want to map by clicking on the feature. This automatically locks the project but mappers in the field won't realise the task is locked. Then, click on 'Go to ODK' to redirect to ODK.
It prefils the building geometry and surveyors can fill up other details and submit the form. 

Step 4: Once the form is submitted, you have to get back to FMTM and select the another feature for mapping. Also sync the data to see the latest updates.
And repeat.

**Note:** You need internet access to update the feature status in real time but you can download or load base imagery without internet connection.
