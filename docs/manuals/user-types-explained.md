## Organisation Manager

- Oversee all projects within an organisation.
- Creating projects and assigning project managers to them.
- For a small organisation, the organisation manager may also be the project
  manager.

## Project Manager

The **Project Manager** is tasked with coordinating all mapping
activities, ensuring that **Field Mappers** are safe and qualified to
work, as well as monitoring data quality.

The **Project Manager** has to consider 3 main activities:

1. **Pre-field data collection activities**
   - Setting up and testing tools
   - Creating the data collection survey ([XLSForm][1])
   - Training field mappers (making sure that they understand the form and how
     to fill it), and providing field instructions
   - Creating an area of interest within the location to be mapped and
     sub-dividing into **tasks** using the provided methods
2. **Data collection activities**
   - Preparing daily, weekly and monthly activity plans
   - Deploying team (assessing safety and qualifications of mappers)
   - Data quality monitoring
   - Optionally allocating mappers to work of specific tasks, or fix
     data quality issues
3. **Post-field data collection activities**
   - Daily review of data
   - Giving and receiving team feedback
   - Updating tools and methodoligies

## Field Mappers

Field mappers select (or are allocated) individual tasks within a project
AOI and use the mobile app to gather data in those areas.

They need to:

- Visit the mapper page available for the project they are working on:
  <https://mapper.fmtm.hotosm.org/{project_Id}>
- Map existing or new features within the area of interest by following
  the [mapper guide][2]

## Validators

Validators review the data collected by field mappers and assess its quality.

If it requires more work, the validators either fix it themselves
(for minor issues like spelling or capitalization mistakes that
don't seem to be systematic),
or inform the field mappers that they need to fix it.

Some of the key requirements are:

- Understanding the mapping project and the intended use of the collected data
- Verifying the accuracy and completeness of the collected data
- Ensuring consistency with existing data and standards
- Providing clear and constructive feedback to field mappers and coordinators
