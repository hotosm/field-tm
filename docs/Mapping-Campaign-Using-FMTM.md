# Tutorial On How To Use FMTM For A Mapping Campaign

A **Mapping Campaign** refers to an organized effort of collecting data from a particular geographic area/feature and creating maps. This may involve using various mapping technologies such as; GPS, satellite imagery, or crowdsourced data. These technologies are used to gather information about the area of interest.

Mapping campaigns can be carried out for lots of different purposes, some examples are:

- Disaster Response and Recovery
- Environmental Conservation
- Urban planning or;
- Social and Political Activism.

They often involve collaboration between organizations like; Government Agencies, Non-profit Groups and volunteers.

Once the data is collected, it is analyzed and processed to create detailed maps that can have a variety of use cases. These could be:

- Identifying areas of need.
- Planning infrastructure and development projects.
- Understanding the impact of environmental changes on the landscape, etc.

### An Overview Of The Field Mapping Tasking Manager (FMTM) In Relations With Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT) and Open Street Mapping (OSM)

The **Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT**) is a non-profit organization that uses open mapping data to support humanitarian and disaster response efforts around the world. **The Field Mapping Task Manager (FMTM)** is one of the tools that **HOT** uses to coordinate and manage mapping projects.

In the context of **HOT**, **FMTM** is a software tool that helps project managers to organize and manage mapping tasks. It assigns those tasks to volunteers and tracks their progress. The tool includes features for collaborative editing, data validation, and error detection. This ensures that the data collected by volunteers is accurate and reliable.

**FMTM** is designed to be used in conjunction with **OpenStreetMap (OSM)**. **OSM** is a free and open-source map of the world that is created and maintained by volunteers. When volunteers use **FMTM** to collect data, that data is typically uploaded to **OSM**, where it is used to create more detailed and accurate maps of the affected area.

Overall, the **FMTM** tool is an important component of **HOT**'s efforts to support disaster response and humanitarian efforts around the world. By coordinating mapping activities and ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the data collected by volunteers, **FMTM** helps to provide critical information that can be used to support decision-making and improve the effectiveness of humanitarian efforts.
