# ðŸŽ‰ Welcome To The Field Tasking Manager Documentation ðŸŽ‰

FieldTM is a versatile mapping tool, used for coordinating groups
of mappers during field mapping campaigns.

Examples of data collected may be population information from
household enumeration surveys, post-disaster damage assessment,
or simply enhancing OpenStreetMap through the addition of
field-verified tags.

## What is ONE thing all the greatest solutions out there have in common?

They never forget the people they are building for ðŸ¤—

So who are we building field mapping solutions for? In short, we build solutions
for:

### The field mapping manager (coordinating field mapping)

The field mapping manager is responsible for coordinating field
mapping activities, ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the data
collected, and managing the data itself. This involves a number of key
steps, including:

- **_Planning:_** The field mapping manager must develop a clear plan
  for the data collection process, including identifying key areas of
  focus and establishing timelines and targets.

- **_Recruitment:_** The field mapping manager must recruit and train
  field mappers, ensuring that they have the necessary skills and
  expertise to collect accurate and high-quality data.

- **_Coordination:_** The field mapping manager must coordinate the activities
  of the field mappers, ensuring that they are working together
  effectively and efficiently.

### The field mapper (collecting data)

The field mapper is responsible for collecting data in the field. To
ensure the success of the field mapper, we must consider a number of key
factors. These include:

- **_Ease of use:_** The field mapper must be able to easily and efficiently
  collect data, without requiring extensive training or technical
  expertise.

- **_Accessibility:_** The field mapper must be able to access and
  collect data from a wide range of environments, including remote or
  hard-to-reach locations.

- **_Data quality:_** The field mapper must be able to ensure the accuracy and
  completeness of the data they collect, as well as identify and address
  any errors or issues that arise.

### The validator (quality checking the data)

The validator is responsible for quality checking the data collected by
the field mapper, ensuring that it is accurate, complete, and free from
errors. The validator faces a number of challenges and issues, including:

- **_Incomplete or inaccurate data:_** The validator must identify and
  address any data that is incomplete, inaccurate, or otherwise flawed.

- **_Conflicting data:_** The validator may encounter data that
  conflicts with other data sources, requiring them to identify and
  resolve any discrepancies.

- **_Data validation protocols:_** The validator must adhere to strict
  validation protocols and guidelines, ensuring that the data meets a high
  level of quality and accuracy.
