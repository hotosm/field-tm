# Welcome To The Field Mapping Wiki!!

**What is ONE thing all the greatest solutions out there have in common?**

They never forget the people they are building for (^^)

So who are we building field mapping solutions for? In short, we build solutions for:

-  The field mapping manager who coordinates field mapping activities.
-  The field mapper who collects data in the field.
-  The validator who checks the quality of the collected data.


Below is an overview of the user flow of the **Field Mapper**, the **Mapping Coordinator / Field Mapping Manager** and the **Validator**.

[Click here](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVPX4XLcI=/?moveToWidget=3458764534814634286&cot=14) to see an overview of who you are building for, which actions they take and some ideas for solutions!

# The Field Mapper (The person who collects data)
The **Field Mapper** surveys locations and collects data from them. The basic work flow that a **Field Mapper** has to consider is as follows:
1. Find a phone that:
    - Works well with the app
    - Has mobile data or an internet plan
2. Install all necessary apps on the phone
3. Access the **OSM** registration site and register
4. Follow the tutorial and choose a campaign
5. Select a task from the campaign
6. Launch the map app which allows you to see the moving map of the points that you are now responsible for.
7. Complete each point within the task, making sure to answer the questions in the form for each one.
8. Send the data of each point until the task is complete
9. Once the task is complete, signal that your task is finished. This lets the **Validator** know that they can check the quality of your data

Some of the key points covered are:

-  Understanding the area and purpose of the mapping project
-  Knowing what data to collect and how to collect it
-  Staying safe and respecting the community while collecting data
-  Properly documenting the collected data and any issues encountered

# The field mapping manager (data coordination)

Click on [this virtual whiteboard](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVPX4XLcI=/?moveToWidget=3458764535077658755&cot=14) to see all the steps a field mapping coordinator or manager goes through. A sneak-peek here:

Some of the key points covered are:

-  Planning and organizing the mapping project
-  Communicating with field mappers and validators
-  Monitoring progress and addressing any issues
-  Ensuring quality control and documentation standards are met

# The validator (data quality)


![Screenshot 2022-10-20 at 12 14 16](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107098623/196922048-c156b8ed-7f1a-404b-a636-fcfca2c0b328.png)

The **Validator** does the following tasks to ensure that quality data is collected and uploaded to **OSM**:
- Logs into task manager
- Checks how many tasks need validation
- Checks tasks for errors 
- Stops mappers that make mistakes and explains how they can fix their errors
- Lowers supervision on good mappers in order to spend more time on those who are stuggling
- Uploads high quality data to **OSM** and marks completed tasks as **done**

Some of the pain points and struggles faced by the **Validator** include:
- Lack of validators (the **Validator** is often the same person as the **Field Mapping Manager**)
- Many areas of the world are still unmapped on online commercial maps
- The quality of maps needs to improve
- The more developers complicate tools, the more they reduce the usefulness of the tools

Some of the key points covered are:

-  Understanding the mapping project and the intended use of the collected data
-  Verifying the accuracy and completeness of the collected data
-  Ensuring consistency with existing data and standards
-  Providing clear and constructive feedback to field mappers and coordinators

Overall, understanding the needs and considerations of each of these three user groups is essential for building effective field mapping solutions.
