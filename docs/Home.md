# Welcome to the field mapping wiki

**What is ONE thing all the greatest solutions out there have in common?**
They never forget the people they are building for (^^)

So who are we building field mapping solutions for? In short:

-  The field mapping manager who coordinates field mapping activities.
-  The field mapper who collects data in the field.
-  The validator who checks the quality of the collected data.

Below is an overview of the user flow of the field mapper, the mapping coordinator and the validator.

# The field mapper (data collection)

Click on [this virtual whiteboard](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVPX4XLcI=/?moveToWidget=3458764535074723879&cot=14) to learn each consideration and need the field mapper has. A sneak-peek here:

Some of the key points covered are:

-  Understanding the area and purpose of the mapping project
-  Knowing what data to collect and how to collect it
-  Staying safe and respecting the community while collecting data
-  Properly documenting the collected data and any issues encountered

# The field mapping manager (data coordination)

Some of the key points covered are:

-  Planning and organizing the mapping project
-  Communicating with field mappers and validators
-  Monitoring progress and addressing any issues
-  Ensuring quality control and documentation standards are met

# The validator (data quality)

Some of the key points covered are:

-  Understanding the mapping project and the intended use of the collected data
-  Verifying the accuracy and completeness of the collected data
-  Ensuring consistency with existing data and standards
-  Providing clear and constructive feedback to field mappers and coordinators

Overall, understanding the needs and considerations of each of these three user groups is essential for building effective field mapping solutions.
