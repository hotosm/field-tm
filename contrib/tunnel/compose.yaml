# Cloudflare Quick Tunnels for external access during local development.
# Used by `just start tunnel` to expose local services over the internet,
# primarily for testing ODK Collect on a physical mobile device.
#
# Each service creates an ephemeral HTTPS tunnel and prints the public URL to logs.
# Retrieve URLs with: `just start view-tunnel-url`
