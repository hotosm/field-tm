    Info on connections vs cursors:
    https://www.psycopg.org/psycopg3/docs/advanced/async.html

    Here we are getting a connection from the pool, which will be returned
    after the session ends / endpoint finishes processing.

    In summary:
    - Connection is created on endpoint call.
    - Cursors are used to execute commands throughout endpoint.
      Note it is possible to create multiple cursors from the connection,
      but all will be executed in the same db 'transaction'.
    - Connection is closed on endpoint finish.

    -----------------------------------
    To use the connection in endpoints:
    -----------------------------------

    @app.get("/something/")
    async def do_stuff(db = Depends(db_conn)):
        async with db.cursor() as cursor:
            await cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM items")
            result = await cursor.fetchall()
            return result

    -----------------------------------
    Additionally, the connection could be passed through to a function to
    utilise the Pydantic model serialisation on the cursor:
    -----------------------------------

    from psycopg.rows import class_row
    async def get_user_by_id(db: Connection, id: int):
