# Create materialized view to store project stats for faster query:
# Using a CTE to get lastest_task_events first, we then calculate:
#  - Total number of contributors (task / entity events)
#  - Total number of complete submissions
#  - Total number of tasks mapped
#  - Total number of task validated as bad
#  - Total number of task validated as good
# Previously we did a big join of all data in the entire database. Now instead:
#  - Uses scalar subqueries, filtered by project_id = p.id (one row per project)
#  - All metrics are isolated subqueries, using indexes efficiently
#  - No big joins, no GROUP BY, no row explosions
#  - Each subquery uses narrow filters (WHERE project_id = p.id)
# NOTE as Field-TM scales and projects increase, we could swap the final
# NOTE    FROM projects p;
# NOTE to
# NOTE    WHERE p.id in (SELECT id FROM projects COUNT xxx);
# NOTE to take a narrower range of IDs and do schedule partial updates to
# NOTE avoid refreshing all in one go. Performance of this takes ~15ms 36 projects.
# TODO We could consider moving back to models.py logic to generate via the API.
